<hr />

<h3>Titanic</h3>
    <p>One of my favorite movie when I was a child (Rose should let Jack with her in the door!)</p>
<h3>Jumper</h3>
    <p>I remember watching this as a teenager. I like how he has the power to teleport.</p>
<h3>A walk to remember</h3>
    <p>I like the romance in this movie with a bit of sadness.</p>
